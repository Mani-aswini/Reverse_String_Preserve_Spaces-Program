# Reverse_String_Preserve_Spaces-Program

Reversing a String While Preserving White Spaces --> 

In a text processing tool used by writers and editors, there's a feature that allows the user to reverse a string, but with a twist-spaces should remain in their original positions. This feature is particularly useful for editing content without disturbing the formatting, such as in certain text manipulations or preparing content for further analysis.
In this, the editor is tasked with reversing the characters in the string while keeping the spaces in place. So, when the user inputs a string, the program should reverse all the non-space characters, but the spaces should stay in their initial locations.

For example, if the user inputs "I love programming", the output should be "g nimm argorpevoll", where the spaces remain exactly where they were originally.

Example:-> 
Input:
  Hello World
Output:
  Reversed String: dlroW olleH
  
Explanation:->
The input string "Hello World" is reversed, but the space between "Hello" and "World" remains in its original position. The result is "olleH dlrow", where only the non-space characters are reversed.

1) Sample Input
    Hello World
Sample Output
    Reversed String: dlrow olleh
2) Sample Input
    I love programming
Sample Output
    Reversed String: g nimm argorpevolI
